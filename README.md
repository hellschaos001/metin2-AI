# metin2 AI

I have created a metin2 AI that helps farming. The AI will automatically pick up the ores from the ground and start minning.

# Requirements:

`python 3.9.x`, `pip` and `tesseract`

You can dawnload tesseract from here `https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki`

- Remember where you installed it because you have to give path to `tesseract.exe` inside code

# How to use:

- First open the game in `800x600` resolution and `not fullscreen`. Otherwise the AI will detect and click the wrong place in the screen.

- This bot is able to farm `up to 6 clients in the same time`, you can farm with as many as you want. After you opened your all clients and place them like in this layout:

- You have to place them at the ore and attack it once, the AI will do the rest after you start it.

- The executable needs to be open as admin.

- If you want to stop it, you have to open the windows that opens from python and press 'Q'

# Check list

- [x] auto attack the ore
- [x] pick ores from the ground
- [ ] finding the ores on minimap
- [ ] changes chanel, moves the clients to ore and start farming it
